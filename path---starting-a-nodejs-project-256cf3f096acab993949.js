When you run it, you'll be prompted for the answers to several different questions. Hitting enter will accept the default, which is fine. The only thing I change is setting the entry point to <code>src/index.js</code>. If you hit enter too fast, you can always manually edit the <code>package.json</code> file later.</p>\n<h2>Create the <code>src</code> Directory</h2>\n<p>Next I create the <code>src</code> folder with <code>mkdir src</code>. I like to put my source code in this directory to avoid having the <code>node_modules</code> directory indexed when I'm using my editor later. I also run <code>touch src/index.js</code> to create a placeholder for the file. If I'm writing a program that has output, I'll also create an <code>output</code> directory in the root of the project.</p>\n<h2>Starting Version Control</h2>\n<p>Even if I'm not planning on uploading my code to GitHub, I typically will start tracking by running <code>git init</code> in the root of my project. This will create an empty repository so you can start tracking changes. If you decide to add a GitHub repo later, you can edit the git config to get it set up.</p>\n<p>When creating a new repository on GitHub, I initialize it without a README or <code>.gitignore</code> file in favor of doing them myself manually later.</p>\n<p>To add a GitHub repo to the project later, run</p>\n<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo-name.git\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Adding a <code>.gitignore</code> File</h2>\n<p>I typically add a <code>.gitignore</code> file that contains the following:</p>\n<pre><code>node_modules/\n.env\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Finished</h2>\n<p>That's pretty much it!</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Starting A Node.js Project",date:"June 27, 2018",path:"/starting-a-nodejs-project",tags:["javascript","nodejs"],excerpt:null}}},pathContext:{next:null,prev:{html:"<h1>My Affinity Method</h1>\n<p>When performing research via surveys, it can be tricky to categorize free text responses.</p>\n<p>One of the most useful techniques I've developed follows the general proceedure of <a href=\"http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/idea-creation-tools/overview/affinity.html\">creating an Affinity Diagram</a>.</p>\n<h3>Three Rules</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do NOT make category assumptions</strong>. It doesn't matter if you <em>know</em> what the themes will be.</li>\n<li><strong>Record an ID to get back to a response</strong>. It saves a lot of time and headaches to record a unique ID (or email address or something) so you can find a person later for following up.</li>\n<li><strong>Do NOT group your groups until you're done processing</strong>. It doesn't take that long to do, which is all the more reason to just wait until you've finished going through the raw data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Process</h3>\n<p><em>This process assumes you've loaded up a bunch of raw survey data into some flavor of spreadsheet app.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Set Up Column Focus</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decide which freeform response you are going to categorize, and hide every column except for the question and an identifier column (UUID, email address, or generate your own).</li>\n<li>Sort the responses in reverse alphabetical (<code>Z-A</code>, yeah) order. Now you don't have to scroll past a bunch of empty cells to get to words.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Start a New Blank Spreadsheet Workbook Thing</strong>\nThis new sheet will be where the categorization happens. I tend to throw everything into a single sheet, and then add additional sheets as needed (the tabs on the bottom when looking at Google Drive).</p>\n<p>The first row will contain headers for each of the general themes that will emrge. Each header should have two columns between them, because the data rows will have some text and the identifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Initial Reading &#x26; Classification</strong>\nMove down, row-by-row, and read the responses. Find the theme(s) of the text, and record some or all of the text under the appropriate column, along with the unique id so that you can find the response later.</p>\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n<p><em>The pizza was great! I love all the unique topping choices, and the music was rad. The ponly thing is that the kid working the register was a little rude.</em></p>\n<pre><code>| Toppings        |    |   | Music               |    |   | Staff |    |\n|-----------------|----|---|---------------------|----|---|-------|----|\n| Loved selection | id |   | \"the music was rad\" | id |   | Rude  | id |\n|                 |    |   |                     |    |   |       |    |\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Summarization</strong>\nAfter breaking responses into groups, it becomes easier to quantify the qualitative data. You could split each theme into positive &#x26; negative, or take it further and group respondents in one theme by answers to another question to find other insights.</p>",id:"/Users/taylor/Documents/Projects/taylorlistens/src/pages/2017-12-19-affinity-method/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2017-12-19T19:49:09.695Z",path:"/affinity-method",title:"My Affinity Chart Method",excerpt:null,tags:["research"]}}}}}});
